# Introduction to Service Design and Engineering (fall 2016) - Assignment 1

This repository contains the solution for the first assignment of the course Introduction to Service Design and Engineering from the University of Trento (fall semester, 2016).

The following topics / technologies are covered in this lab assignment:
- Java
- XML/XSD
- JSON
- XPATH
- JAXB/Jackson

## Getting Started

This will execute the tests scenarios described in the src/Assignment1.java class source code. The project has been divided into 3 layers for presentation (i.e. showing the tests results in stdout), the business logic and object-relational mapping features. The generated output and input XML/JSON files will be stored in the "data" directory.

To test the source code corresponding to the exercise cases, simply run the included Ant build.xml file. 

### Prerequisites

In order to run the code from this repository, you need to have the following software installed in your machine:

```
Java
Ant
```

## Running the tests

Run the execute.evaluation target inside the build.xml file (ant execute.evaluation). This will compile all the necessary Java code and provide the test results.
